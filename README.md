## Instructions

1. Customize server.py with your Last.fm API key and username.

2. Adjust the IP address in server.py to match your server's IP address. If you're hosting this on a home server, ensure you've port forwarded your home IP address to port 8000 (or your chosen port).

3. Ensure server.py can run in the background to allow your website access to your scrobbled songs.

4. Update your website to include the IP address and port where the API is hosted. Failure to do so will result in your music not being displayed!

Run your site and the server.py file to enjoy seamless integration between Last.fm and your website!
